# Computer-Design
Type: School Project
Team Size: 2
Objective and Achievements:Designed and implemented
components of a basic computer system using VeriLog,
focusing on:

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Developed to perform
arithmetic and logical operations, including flag generation
for zero, carry, negative, and overflow.

Registers and Memory: Implemented a 16-bit general
register, Instruction Register (IR), Register File, and Address

Register File (ARF) for efficient data storage and
manipulation.

Control Logic: Used selectors for managing ALU operations
and data flow.

System Integration: Combined modules like the ALU,
Register File, and ARF into a cohesive system capable of
executing sequential operations.

This project improved skills in digital circuit design, VeriLog
programming, and system integration within a digital
framework.
All implementations and the detailed reports are available
on my GitHub repository.
